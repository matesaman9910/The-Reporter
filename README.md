# The Reporter

A single-page launcher for reporting malicious links/files and for analyzing suspicious content.
Ships with three curated profiles:
- **Top 5 — GPT research (2025‑08‑11)**
- **Best for Public Protection**
- **Best for Research / Evidence**

## GitHub Pages: one‑click publish
1. Create a new repo on GitHub, e.g. `the-reporter`.
2. Upload these files (drag & drop): `index.html`, `.nojekyll`, and this `README.md`.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set _Source_ to **Deploy from a branch**, pick the default branch (main/master), and **/ (root)**.
4. Save — wait a minute or two. Your site will be live at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Local dev
Double‑click `index.html` to open it. All assets are embedded or loaded from trusted CDNs/file links you already use.

## Notes
- The cinematic intro needs a **user click** to start the audio (browser policy). Click **ENGAGE**.
- Pop‑up blockers may block "Open All". Allow multiple tabs for the site for the quickest workflow.
- Copyright line applies **only** to this page; linked sites belong to their respective owners.
